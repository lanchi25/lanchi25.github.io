								<h2>Project Details </h2>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Problem Statement</b>: Atliq Hardwares - a computer hardware business facing challenges to increase revenue in a dynamically changing market. The sales director needs a dashdboard that can give him real-time sales insights that will provid him insights to increase revenue.</li>
									<li><b>What I will do </b>: As a data analyst I will provide this dashboard to the sales director. Provided sales insights that are not visible before for sales team for decision support & automate them to reduced manual time spent in data gathering.</li>

								<h2>Analysis </h2>
								<ul>
									<p><b>Data Discovery</b>: <br />
									<div class="image main"><img src="images/datadiscovery_sale.jpg" alt="" /></div>
										The data was pulled from OLTP which is SQL Server, in my case they do all the tranformation which is also called ETL(extract, transform and load). After doing that they store the data in a data warehouse. By doing this transformation they are reformatting the data in a way that is best for performing analytical query. After that data analysts pull the data from data warehouse and they will build dashboard. For simplicity, I will have an SQL database and then directly pug Power BI to that and build dashboard.</p>
									<b>Data Analysis Using SQL </b>:<br/ >
										<!-- Preformatted Code -->
									<i>1. Show all customer records</i>
									<pre><code>SELECT * FROM customers;

</code></pre>
									<i>2. Show total numer of customers</i>
									<pre><code>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers;

</code></pre>	
									<i>3. Show total revenue in year 2020, January Month</i>
									<pre><code>SELECT SUM(sales_amount) FROM transactions INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date = date.date WHERE date.year = 2020 and date.month_name = 'January' and transactions.currency = 'INR\r' or transactions.currency = 'USD\r';
</code></pre>	
										
									<i>4. Show total revenue in year 2020 in Chennai</i>
									<pre><code>SELECT SUM(*) FROM transactions INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date = date.date WHERE date.year = 2020 and transactions.market_code = 'Mark001' and transactions.currency = 'INR\r' or transactions.currency = 'USD\r';
</code></pre>	


									<b>Data cleaning & ETL </b>
									<li>Use SQL to extract and load data to Power BI</li>
									<li>Use Power query to clean and transform data</li>
									<li>DAX, Measure:</br></li>
									<i>1. Show all customer records</i>
									<pre><code>= Table.AddColumn(#"Filtered Rows", "norm_amount", each if [currency] = "USD" or [currency] = "USD\r" then [sales_amount]*75 else [sales_amount], type any)

								<p><b>Insights </b><br />
								<i>1. Overview of Revenue and Sales Quantity</i>: Total revenue is 984.81M, while total sales quantity is 2.43M. This indicates that the average value per product is relatively high.
								<i> 2. Revenue by Markets</i>: Delhi NCR has the highest revenue (519.51M), accounting for a significant portion of total revenue. Mumbai and Ahmedabad rank second and third, with 150.08M and 132.31M, respectively. Some markets have low revenue, such as Bengaluru (0.37M), Bhubaneswar (2.61M), and Surat (2.02M).
									=> Markets like Delhi NCR, Mumbai, and Ahmedabad have high potential, while smaller markets may require strategies to boost sales.
								<i>3. Sales quantity by Markets</i>: Dehi NCR also leads in sales volume, with 0.99M units sold. Other markets have significantly lower sales, such as Mumbai (0.38M). Nagpur (0.26M), and Ahmedabad (0.21M).
									=> Even though Mumbai has the second-highest revenue, its sales volume is not a high as Delhi NCR. This suggest that product sold in Mumbai may have a higher average value.
								<i>4. Revenue Trend Over Time</i>: Revenue shows fluctuations, peaking around 2018-2019 but declinding slightly afterward.
									=> Futher analysis is needed to determine the reason for the recent decline (market factors, seasonality, or economic conditions).
								<i>5. Product Type Breakdown</i>: 68.46% of revenue comes from Distribution (third-party products). 31.54% comes from Own Brand products. This suggest that most revenue comes from third-party brands instead of in-house products.
									=> The company may consider focusing on expanding its Own Brand to increase profitability. For three reason: Own Brand products typically have higher profit margins, Brand loyalty and competittive edge and better supply chain control.
								<i>6. Top customers</i>: Electricalsara Stores is the biggest customer, contributing 413.33M in revenue. Other key customers generate much lower revenue, ranging form 49M to 44M.
									=> It's important to maintain a strong relationship with the largest customer while diversifying the customer base to reduce dependency risks.
								<i>7. Top - Selling Products</i>: One product category labeled as "Blank" accounts for 468.96M, which may indicate a data issue. Other top products generate revenue between 15M - 23M.
									=> The company should check for data errors and evaluate product strategies to futher boost best-selling items.

								
								<p></p><b>Recommendation </b>
								The business should:<br />
									<li>Run creative seasonal marketing campaigns (voucher, discount,..) with different products. Besides the best-selling items, we need to have marketing campaigns for the items that are not selling well.</li>
									<li>Invest more in high-revenue markets like Dehli NCR, Mumbai, and Ahmadabad.</li>
									<li>Analysze the reason for the recent revenue decline and adjust business plans accodingly such as expand into emerging markets, consuct competitor and customer analysis, address aupply chain ineddiciencies,... </li>
									<li>Expand Own Brand products as a long-term opportunity for higher profit margins.
									<li>Listen and record customer feedback about products and services... To find out the product categories would benefit most from in-house production.</li><br /></p>

									<h1>2. Shopping Customer Segmentation
									</h1>
									
									<p>In this data analysis project, I performed customer segmentation on a specific group of mall customers. I dentify the best possible cluster using the KMeans unsupervised machine learning algorithm to find the univariate, bivariate, and multivariate clusters. Once these clusters are identify, summary statistics can be performed on these to identify the best marketing group.</p>
